# Text Generation with GPT-2

Welcome to the Text Generation with GPT-2 project! This project focuses on generating coherent and contextually relevant text using GPT-2.

## Introduction

Text generation involves creating new text that is coherent and contextually relevant based on a given prompt. In this project, we leverage the power of GPT-2 to perform text generation tasks.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of prompts. You can create your own prompts and place them in the `data/sample_prompts.txt` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt2_text_generation.git
cd gpt2_text_generation

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes prompts for text generation. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a text file with one prompt per line.

# To fine-tune the GPT-2 model for text generation, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/sample_prompts.txt

# To generate text using the fine-tuned model, run:
python scripts/generate.py --model_path models/
